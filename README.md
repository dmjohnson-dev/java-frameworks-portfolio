# Java Frameworks Portfolio Project

This repository contains a Java-based web application developed to demonstrate the use of modern Java frameworks, application layering, and backend development best practices.

## Project Overview

The project showcases a structured Java application using a framework-based approach to handle application logic, data management, and user interaction. It emphasizes clean architecture, separation of concerns, and maintainable code design.

This repository represents a **portfolio version** of an academic project originally completed as part of the Computer Science program at Western Governors University.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Framework (Spring Boot)
- Maven
- RESTful APIs
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Git / GitHub

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Java framework configuration and usage
- Dependency injection
- Controller–service–repository architecture
- Data handling and validation
- Backend application design
- Version control with Git

## Project Structure


- `src/main/java` — application source code  
- `src/main/resources` — configuration and resources  
- `pom.xml` — Maven project configuration  

## How to Run

1. Open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
2. Ensure Java and Maven are installed
3. Build the project using Maven
4. Run the application using the main Spring Boot entry point
5. Access the application locally as configured

## Notes

This repository is intended for **portfolio and demonstration purposes**.  
All proprietary academic instructions and grading materials have been removed.
